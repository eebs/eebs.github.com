    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some background: One of the things my company and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/03/forrester-saas-and-data-driven-smart-apps-fueling-worldwide-software-growth/">many</a> <a href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/in-depth/cloud-computing/3419286/saas-in-2013-companies-trends-watch/">others</a> are doing is moving to a more SaaS oriented business model. It&#8217;s a growing space in software engineering, and as we see more and more cloud based services I can only expect this trend to continue. SaaS provides many benefits, especially for a rapidly changing product as ours. SaaS would allow us to roll out features to clients quickly and in a scalable manner, ensuring some level of consistency across all clients without having to worry about which version a client was on, which version fixed a bug they had, etc. We recently made some changes to our software that made it technically feasible to use a SaaS methodology, allowing us to run multiple clients off one instance of our product. We don&#8217;t currently have that set up, but we&#8217;re definitely moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>So with all this in mind, when I saw that Berkeley edX was offering a course on SaaS, I figured I&#8217;d take it. It&#8217;s taught using TDD, Agile development, and Rails, all of which I&#8217;m familiar and use both at work and at home. The software engineering course I took at university wasn&#8217;t very helpful to me, and I thought it might be fun to take a course that appears to be more in line with my expectations for a software engineering course.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gone through the first two lectures, most of which is just a general overview of what SaaS is, and agile development is, and how they contrast to other practices. The next two lectures are available, along with the first homework and quiz, but I haven&#8217;t had time to go through them yet. I think the course will be a great experience, as it&#8217;s only about 6-12 hours of work a week for five weeks. There is a follow up, more advanced course that I plan on taking afterwards. I&#8217;m hoping there will be other contemporary CS classes offered via edX. I think it&#8217;s a great opportunity for students and graduates to see a different aspect of software engineering that doesn&#8217;t seem to be taught in typical classes very often.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll do another post at the end of the course with my thoughts on how it went, and any new practices or concepts I learned. <a href="https://www.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS169.1x/2013_Spring/about">You can still register for the course</a> if you&#8217;re interested, or check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V36LpHqtcDY">intro video</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>- Warning: Technical -</em></p>

<p>Today I had the joy of dealing with a particularly annoying problem at work. What should have taken me about two minutes to set up, ended up taking an hour and a half and four people&#8217;s time.</p>

<p>To understand this post, you first need to know a little bit about how some of <a href="http://kurogo.org/home/">our software</a> works. Most of the modules in our software talk to external data sources, pulling in content and feeds from different types of backends the client may have. We have some modules however, that talk to our own internally developed backend. Our own backend we&#8217;ll call the content server (CMS), and the consumer we&#8217;ll call the application server (app server).</p>

<p>One of the things I needed to do today for one of our designers was to hook up the app server to the CMS, so he could theme the site and make it look good. This should have been a very simple process, but when I put everything in place I got a lovely error saying the CMS wasn&#8217;t available. I was able to make the calls via my browser, so I knew the CMS was functioning fine, must be an issue with the app server. I added some debugging code to the component that makes the request, and was greeted by a lovely cURL SSL error:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl: (35) error:14077458:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:reason(1112)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I did what all good software engineers do, and Googled the error, which lead me to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1037/">this ticket</a>. The short of it is that when a client using OpenSSL 0.9.8 connects to a server using OpenSSL 1.0, a TLS alert is raised, which causes OpenSSL 0.9.8 to explode. The tricky part is that this only happens when the server doesn&#8217;t have an Apache ServerName or ServerAlias option that matches the request domain name. It just so happened that our CMS server was running 1.0, and my local machine was running 0.9.8. The CMS also didn&#8217;t have a valid ServerName set, and so I got this error. We have several other instances of this type of connection (app server to CMS) running, but this was the first time it happened in the particular manner.</p>

<p>We found a couple fixes. The easiest is to simply add a matching ServerName option to the CMS server. The other option was to force SSLv3 in cURL, which magically made this bug disappear. It was obnoxious to track down because no one else could reproduce it, but I was very clearly getting an error.</p>

<p>While I love OpenSSL and the wonders it offers, it can sometimes be very annoying to work with.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you can clearly see, I just finished installing <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. Over the past few weeks I have had sudden urges to write things down, either for discussion or mental relief. I used to have a blog on Wordpress several years ago, but I stopped writing for a while, and eventually trashed it. I figured I&#8217;d start one up again, using it to document various projects or ideas of mine.</p>

<p>I saw a post on Reddit about installing Octopress on Windows, and something about the Octo/Github wording made me click the link. Once I figured out what Octopress was, I realized I most definitely wouldn&#8217;t want to install it on Windows, but I may check it out on my laptop. Octopress is a &#8220;blogging framework for hackers&#8221;, which sounds fairly intriguing. It&#8217;s built to use <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, something I had heard of in the past, mostly from <a href="http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/">Kyle Rush&#8217;s</a> blog post on the Obama fundraising platform. It&#8217;s written in Ruby, my new favorite language, so I decided I&#8217;d try it out.</p>

<p>I followed the installation instructions on the Octopress page, and the install went smoothly. Github pages took a little while to build, but once it was up it worked well. I even managed to hook it up to my own domain. Using git to make posts is a little weird, but I think I&#8217;ll get used to the process. There are some helper commands (implemented as rake tasks) that you can run to make new posts, generate the site, and even deploy, which makes things much easier. I&#8217;m still going to have to write some aliases because for whatever reason I have to run <code>bundle exec rake</code> instead of just <code>rake</code>. A couple of the commands seem to be often run in sequence, so I&#8217;ll probably make an alias to run them together. I&#8217;ll try and remember to post those here somewhere (I think Octopress has built in gist support or something).</p>

<p><em>- Edit -</em> Found the gist support:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4535615.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>alias octo='bundle exec rake'
alias octog='bundle exec rake generate'
alias octod='bundle exec rake deploy'
alias octogd='bundle exec rake generate &amp;&amp; bundle exec rake deploy'</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure what I&#8217;ll end up using this blog for mostly, but it&#8217;ll probably be a fair amount of everything. Maybe there will be some rants about code, or links to neat articles. I might add some posts about EvE Online, or maybe some entries about my ongoing Rails projects.</p>

<p>Who knows.</p>
